        FORESTS ARE HOME TO OVER 80% OF THE WORLD'S LAND-BASED SPECIES OF
        ANIMALS, PLANTS AND INSECTS These animals help to keep the forest
        healthy. For example, elephants distribute seeds from fruits they have
        eaten. When the seeds pass through their gut, they come out undigested
        in their dung, and germinate in the ground.
